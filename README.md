# README

To run the project create a `.env` file with the following
run `bundle install`

```
DB_URI=<mogodb cloud uri>
PORT=3001
```

With that in the root folder, run `rails server` and let the server run which will expose our graphql api.

cd into `frontend` folder and run `yarn install`
after a successfull installation run `yarn start`
this serves the front end on `http://localhost:3000/`
